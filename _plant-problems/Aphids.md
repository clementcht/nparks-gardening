<br>
Aphids are sap-sucking insects that are small and pear-shaped. They come in various colors â€“ green, yellow, brown-red or black and can be winged or wingless. Aphids have needle-like mouthparts that they use to pierce into the plant tissue to feed. They are usually found on plant stems and the undersides of leaves.
<br><br>
Aphids produce honeydew (a sweet fluid) as a waste product while feeding that ants love. Hence, ants may guard and care for aphids in return for food. Therefore, when you notice ants climbing around your plant, you may want to take closer look for the presence of aphids.
<br><br>
Aphids largely do not cause great damage when caught early. However, if they are left unattended for a period, aphids can infest and weaken the plant, causing stunted growth, fruit deformities or even death. They also spread many viral plant diseases as they travel plant to plant to reproduce.
